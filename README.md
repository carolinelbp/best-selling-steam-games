# Best Selling Steam Games
SQL Intermediate 'Practice Loop' mini-project
<br>

### ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning & Manipulation
- I split data into three CSV files based on where the field info came from - game_faqs, steam_main, steam_db. 
- I changed the format of the 'release_date' in Excel - to remove a comma in each row.
- I created a new table with SQL - to separate the multiple genre entries in each row of the 'user_defined_tags' field - named 'game_genres':
- I deleted 10 genre lines from game_genres. 
<br>

## Joins & Aggregates

### JOIN practice

I searched for the 10 game records with missing genre fields, to practice LEFT and RIGHT JOINs. 

```sql 

SELECT m.game_name, 
	g.genre
FROM steam_main AS m
LEFT JOIN game_genres AS g
	ON m.game_name = g.game_name
WHERE g.genre IS NULL; 

```

```sql 

SELECT m.game_name, 
	g.genre
FROM game_genres AS g
RIGHT JOIN steam_main AS m
	ON m.game_name = g.game_name
WHERE g.genre IS NULL; 

```

### Write a query using at least 2 JOINs. 

I searched records with all their game genres present and then filtered for difficulty over 3. 

```sql

SELECT m.game_name, 
	g.genre,
	f.difficulty
FROM steam_main AS m
LEFT JOIN game_genres AS g
	ON m.game_name = g.game_name
INNER JOIN game_faqs AS f
	ON m.game_name = f.game_name
WHERE g.genre IS NOT NULL 
	AND m.game_name IN (
		SELECT f.game_name
		FROM game_faqs AS f
		WHERE f.difficulty > 3
	)
ORDER BY f.difficulty DESC;

```

### Create a summary table using GROUP BY and COUNT/SUM/AVG.

Which developers have produced the most best-selling Steam games? 

```sql
SELECT developer,
	COUNT(developer) AS number_of_games
FROM steam_main
GROUP BY developer
ORDER BY number_of_games DESC
LIMIT 5;

```
